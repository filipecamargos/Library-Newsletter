      <br>Doing Hard Things
      <br>"I discovered that I could learn something entirely new."</p>

      <div class="text-message">
        <p>Have you ever felt like you couldn’t do something? Couldn’t take on a new calling at 
          Church, speak in public, stick with your exercise plan, save some money, or get more sleep 
          at night? Many of us make resolutions at the beginning of a new year, or at the start of a 
          new semester and then decide the goal we set just seems too far off. But we are often reminded 
          that when we stretch outside our comfort zone we grow. Well, that’s more than just a cliché, 
          it’s a solid piece of advice</p>
        <p>Completing a tough course assignment is something most students face every semester. It might 
          be a paper you have to write on a topic you don’t particularly care about, or a project in art, 
          sewing or engineering. I can relate to your stress! I was a non-traditional student (I was a lot 
          older than you all are now) when I went back to school for my master’s degree. One of the courses 
          required a semester-long analysis and written discussion of a book of our choosing using a different 
          methodology than the author used to write it; specifically one that was outside our comfort zone. 
          The process was awkward and required me to gain an understanding of other perspectives, as well as 
          frequently review the instructions to make sure that I was staying on track.</p>
        <p>The assignment seemed to consume my thoughts and my time that semester, and I was relieved once it 
          was completed and turned in to the instructor. But an interesting thing happened to me during the 
          process. I discovered that I could learn something entirely new, do something that was really hard 
          and stick to the task until it was completed successfully. The sense of accomplishment and feelings 
          of personal success I had were more important to me than the grade. I won’t say that future research 
          projects became easier, but I now find that I enjoy the process of learning. My comfort zone expanded.</p>
        <p>Hopefully there comes a time in each of our lives that we realize stretching beyond our comfort zone 
          improves our lives, in small ways, just a little bit each time we take the opportunity. We can look back 
          and measure our progress by the increased size of our comfort zone.</p>
        <p>Knowing we did something hard and followed through encourages us to reach just a tiny bit farther next 
            time, like breathing deeper to get one more liter of fresh air in our lungs. It simply makes us feel better</p>
